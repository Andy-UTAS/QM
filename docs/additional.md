# Additional resources

This page is the space for additional resources which may prove to be of some use and/or interest for curious individuals.

!!! info "Websites"
    - [Modern Physics: Quantum Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzhlfbWBuQ8&list=PL84C10A9CB1D13841) by Leonard Susskind from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) is a popular youtube series covering much of the content of this course. The series was recorded in 2008 and thus the audio and video quality is left wanting, but the content is very well presented.

!!! info "Texts"
    - Undergraduate texts for quantum mechanics are common; however, concise, informed, relevant, and entertaining texts are much less common. I think the prescribed text is the best text for this course, but an excellent alternative which follows a similar approach to the material is [A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition](https://uscibooks.aip.org/books/a-modern-approach-to-quantum-mechanics-second-edition/) by John S. Townsend from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/). If you are looking for a more traditional presentation of introductory quantum mechanics, a classic of the genre is [Introduction to Quantum Mechanics](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/introduction-to-quantum-mechanics/990799CA07A83FC5312402AF6860311E#overview) by David J. Griffiths and Darrell F. Schroeter from [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/).
    - [Quantum Mechanics](https://atomoptics-nas.uoregon.edu/~dsteck/teaching/quantum-mechanics/quantum-mechanics-notes.pdf) and [Quantum and Atom Optics](https://atomoptics-nas.uoregon.edu/~dsteck/teaching/quantum-optics/quantum-optics-notes.pdf) by Daniel A. Steck from the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/): marvellous books that have been diligently curated and provide excellent reading, although are more advanced for the most part. The Quantum Mechanics text is highly pertinent to this course, and the Quantum and Atom Optics text, whilst more pertinent for both the atomic physics and solid-state physics courses to follow, contains relevant content and includes some of the most interesting material one is likely to encounter in the realm of quantum mechanics[^1]; however, it is pitched at the graduate level and assumed knowledge of material not taught in the UTAS undergraduate program. I still think it worthwhile as an additional resource, but don't fret if it becomes a bit hard to follow once it gets into the weeds.
    - [Harry Potter and the methods of rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/) by [Eliezer Eudkowsky](https://www.yudkowsky.net/). Who know that Harry Potter fan fiction could provide such insight. As a jumping off point: _Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit._

!!! info "Previous course notes"

    Quantum mechanics at UTAS is taught every year, with the previous course outing having been taught by [Stas Shabala](https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/cose-natural-sciences-physics/stas-shabala) and [Andrew Cole](https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/cose-natural-sciences-physics/andrew-cole) for advanced wave mechanics and quantum mechanics respectively. The notes from the 2022 course are posted here as a reference, but it should be emphasised that the course structure is vastly different, and consequently one's mileage may vary.

    !!! example "Advanced wave mechanics"

        <!-- * [Week 1](/legacy/ss1.pdf): The lectures from week 1 of the Solid State Physics sequence, covering the introduction to solid state physics; the definition of a crystal; close-packed crystal structures; the Wigner-Seitz primitive cell; calculation of cohesive energy for an ionic solid; introduction to covalent and metallic solids.
        * [Week 2](/legacy/ss2.pdf) - Lectures from week 2 of solid state: diffraction and scattering of x-rays, neutrons, and electrons by crystals. Bragg's Law, reciprocal lattices, Brillouin zones. Mechanical properties of solids: compressibility, stress, strain, dilation. Bulk modulus, shearing, and Poisson's ratio. Mechanical wave propagation.
        * [Week 3](/legacy/ss3.pdf) - Crystal vibrations in the quantum limit; phonons. Monatomic and diatomic linear chains, and the optical vs. acoustic wave modes; phonon momentum. Thermal properties of solids. The law of Dulong & Petit, the Einstein model for state density, and the Debye model for specific heat.
        * [Week 4](/legacy/ss4.pdf) - Introduction to Electrons in solids: the classical free electron picture, drift velocity and relaxation time. The Drude model for conductivity. The Fermi energy. Heat capacity of electrons, resistivity, conductivity, Ohm's Law, electron-phonon scattering. Magnetism: the Hall effect; the Weidemann-Franz law.
        * [Week 5](/legacy/ss5.pdf) - Updates to electrons in solids: Umklapp scattering and resistivity; the Lorenz number of a metal. Magnetism: the Hall effect, magnetic susceptibility, diamagnetism, paramagnetism, Brillouin functions, and the Curie law for paramagnetism. Spontaneous magnetization, the Curie temperature, and the Weiss field (Exchange torque). -->

<!--
        * [Section 1](/legacy/Semi1.pdf): Introduction to band theory looking at the Bloch Theorem, Kronig-Penney Model and the Empty Lattice Approximation. These are used to explain the electrical properties of solids, including conductors, insulator and simple intrinsic semiconductors.
        * [Section 2: Conduction properties of Semiconductors](/legacy/Semi2.pdf). This module looks at how the Fermi-Dirac distribution describes the changing conductivity of intrinsic semiconductors with temperature and explore how doping the crystal lattice with other atoms affects the conductivity. 
        * [Section 3: PN Junctions and diodes](/legacy/Semi3.pdf). A brief look at some of the practical applications of semiconductors including light-emitting diodes and photo detectors. This includes a detailed description of the electrical behaviour of pn-junctions, crystals with one half doped with one type of atom and the other half with atoms from different group. -->

[^1]: and I am not just saying this because my research has been in this area, it is objectively true!
