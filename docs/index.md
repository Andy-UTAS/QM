# Welcome to the home of quantum mechanics

This site exists to enhance the distribution of course information and content for the measurement component of [KYA321: Quantum Mechanics](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya321-quantum-mechanics). All official communication will be though [MyLO](https://mylo.utas.edu.au/)[^1].

As part of this course, we will investigate what it means to make a measurement of a quantum system. We shall develop tools, techniques, and machinery for modelling measurements, and look at real-world quantum systems and their applications. </figcaption>

!!! warning "Course expectations: my expectations of you"

    Solid-state physics is where the rubber meets the road: abstract concepts will be applied in an effort to model realistic and complex systems. There are delights are to be had, but like most truly rewarding endeavours, said delights do not come for free. In undertaking this course, it is expected that:

    - You will view the video content __before__ any scheduled face-to-face sessions
    - Prescribed problems and reading will be undertaken before any face-to-face sessions
    - You will attend all face-to-face sessions, and actively contribute to discussions and problem solving
    - If you are experiencing difficulties, that you will get in contact as soon as is reasonably possible

!!! info "Course objectives"

    The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the world of solid-state physics. At the conclusion of your journey, you should:

    - Be familiar with the main models of solid-state physics, and their application to real-world systems
    - Have proficiency parsing and extracting information from applied solid-state systems, with an eye to identification the relevant theoretical framework(s) and the concise formulation of physics to be investigated
    - Have experience identifying and applying appropriate approximations and physical insight to make difficult problems more tractable
    - Be familiar with experimental and analytical apparatus relevant to probing solid-state systems, in addition to some of the main systems and devices one might encounter _in the wild_
    - Have had some fun!

!!! warning "Course expectations: my promises to you"

    Rightly, you should have expectations of me. It is my intention that:

    - I will work to communicate my understanding and insight in the course material
    - I will actively seek input to steer and shape the content discussed, and develop relevant resources
    - I will be widely available for consultation and discussion
    - I will do my best to cultivate a safe and open forum for discussion

    If you think that I am not fulfilling my commitments, or if you have other comments, I would hope that you are comfortable conveying your concerns and/or comments to me, either directly or anonymously. It is my genuine desire to help you navigate learning new concepts and ideas, and I want to do this to the best of my ability, and feedback is the best way to ensure this endeavour proceeds as smoothly as possible.
