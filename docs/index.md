# Welcome to the home of quantum mechanics

This site exists to enhance the distribution of course information and content for the measurement component of [KYA321: Quantum Mechanics](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya321-quantum-mechanics). All official communication will be though [MyLO](https://mylo.utas.edu.au/)[^1].

As part of this course, we will investigate what it means to make a measurement of a quantum system. We shall develop tools, techniques, and machinery for modelling measurements, and look at real-world quantum systems and their applications. </figcaption>

!!! warning "Course expectations: my expectations of you"

    Quantum mechanics is tough! And this isn't (necessarily) hyperbole: physics is often put in the "hard" basket for a number of reasons, not least due to it being seen as irrelevant or mathematically challenging. Whilst the mathematics can indeed by spicy, once can develop coping mechanisms for this, and at its heart physics is usually intuitive: the apple falls from the tree, like charges repel, and so on. At first glance, quantum mechanics can present very differently, and is rarely accused of being intuitive. There are delights are to be had, but like most truly rewarding endeavours, said delights do not come for free. In undertaking this course, it is expected that:

    - You will view the video content __before__ any scheduled face-to-face sessions
    - Prescribed problems and reading will be undertaken before any face-to-face sessions
    - You will attend all face-to-face sessions, and actively contribute to discussions and problem solving
    - If you are experiencing difficulties, that you will get in contact as soon as is reasonably possible

!!! info "Course objectives"

    The purpose of the measurements and applications component of the quanutm course is to provide an overview of quantum mechanics, demystifying some of the foundational theory and providing a toolkit for studying both old and new problems. At the conclusion of your journey, you should:

    - Be familiar with the building blocks of quantum mechanical analysis: state vectors, operators and measurement, and time evolution
    - Be versed in various aspects of interpretations of quantum mechanics: what does it mean to make a measurement? What is entaglement? Why are the EPR paradox, Bell's inequalities, and _Schr√∂dinger's Cat_ interesting?
    - Have studied quantum applications, from MRI machines to truly secure communications
    - Have had some fun!

!!! warning "Course expectations: my promises to you"

    Rightly, you should have expectations of me. It is my intention that:

    - I will work to communicate my understanding and insight in the course material
    - I will actively seek input to steer and shape the content discussed, and develop relevant resources
    - I will be available for consultation and discussion
    - I will do my best to cultivate a safe and open forum for discussion

    If you think that I am not fulfilling my commitments, or if you have other comments, I would hope that you are comfortable conveying your concerns and/or comments to me, either directly or anonymously. It is my genuine desire to help you navigate learning new concepts and ideas, and I want to do this to the best of my ability, and feedback is the best way to ensure this endeavour proceeds as smoothly as possible.
