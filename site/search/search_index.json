As part of this course, we will investigate what it means to make a measurement of a quantum system. We shall develop tools, techniques, and machinery for modelling measurements, and look at real-world quantum systems and their applications.  <p>Course expectations: my expectations of you</p> <p>Quantum mechanics is tough! And this isn't (necessarily) hyperbole: physics is often put in the \"hard\" basket for a number of reasons, not least due to it being seen as irrelevant or mathematically challenging. Whilst the mathematics can indeed by spicy, once can develop coping mechanisms for this, and at its heart physics is usually intuitive: the apple falls from the tree, like charges repel, and so on. At first glance, quantum mechanics can present very differently, and is rarely accused of being intuitive.
