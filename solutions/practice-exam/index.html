<p>The practice exam can be found <a href="../exams/Mockexam.pdf">here</a>, and it was written to provide a flavour for the style of examination one can expect from the course as taught by me, rather than the past examinations which have followed a different course structure. Given this is pitched as a learning tool, I have included some discussion that would not be expected in an exam, but in addition to helping you achieve the best possible result on the exam, I care much more about you learning and understanding the content: hopefully this resource proves useful.</p>
<h2 id="question-1">Question 1<a class="headerlink" href="#question-1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This question focuses on the physics of solids without considering the microscopic structure.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the Einstein model of a solid? List both the successes and the shortcomings of the model.</p>
<p>The Einstein model builds on the Boltzmann model for solids, which described matter as being comprised of particles interacting through a harmonic potential which was modelled using statistical mechanics. Einsein's model was to say the each particle was in an identical harmonic potential (characterised by oscillation frequency <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega\)</span>), which was basically injecting a basic form of quantum mechanics. This had the effect of explaining the low-temperature behaviour of the heat capacity (name that is "freezes out"), but under predicts the heat capacity as there are no additional ways to store energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the assumptions of the Debye model of heat capacity for a solid.</p>
<p>The Debye model remedies some of the shortcomings of the Einstein model by considering collective oscillations of particles in the solid, specifically noting that waves should exist in a solid (sound waves, or later, phonons) and these could be quantised in the same way as the light field (à la Plank). The fundamental assumption of the model as we consider it are the system is isotropic, with 3 polarisations of sound waves which obey a linear dispersion relation. Importantly, there is also a maximum frequency up to which oscillations occur and beyond this, they no longer occur, but there is no physical grounding to this justification, rather it just makes the maths work out.</p>
<p>Whilst the Debye model does a better job than the Einstein model, notably reproducing the <span class="arithmatex">\(T^3\)</span> behaviour of the heat capacity at low temperature, it fails to include energy stored by electrons in the material, which the Sommerfeld/free-electron model incorporates to give a pretty good model where one is agnostic to the microscopic properties of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Einstein obtained an expression for the expectation value of the energy of a single oscillator at frequency <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega\)</span>
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\langle E \rangle = \hbar\omega\left(n_{\mathrm{B}} (\beta\hbar\omega) + \frac{1}{2}\right)\)</span>\)</span>
Consider a three-dimensional solid as modelled using the framework of Debye.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write an expression for the total energy in the system for oscillators with frequencies <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega(\mathbf{k})\)</span></p>
<p>The expression above provides the energy for a <em>single</em> oscillator, and we have a bunch of them, so we need to add them up! In the usual way, because of the 3 modes of polarisation (spin) there is a factor of 3 out the front, but otherwise the result follows directly from above:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \langle E \rangle = 3 \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \hbar \omega(\mathbf{k}) \left(n_{\mathrm{B}} (\beta\hbar\omega(\mathbf{k})) + \frac{1}{2}\right)</script>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the density of states <span class="arithmatex">\(g(\omega)\)</span>? Justify the validity of the expression
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">E = \int_0^{\omega_\textrm{cutoff}} \mathrm{d}\omega~g(\omega)~\hbar\omega~\left[n_\mathrm{B}(\beta\hbar\omega(\mathbf{k})) + 1/2 \right] </script>
</p>
<p>The density of states <span class="arithmatex">\(g(\omega)\)</span> (as it says on tin!) tells you about the number of states per unit frequency (in this case). More succinctly, the number of states between <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{d}{\omega}\)</span> is given by <span class="arithmatex">\(g(\omega)\mathrm{d}{\omega}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to justify the expression, we will need to take the result from the previous question and show it is equivalent to that stated. To start, in the usual way we must convert the sum to an integral. Ultimately this happens as we impose periodic boundary conditions to the problem, which has the effect of discretising reciprocal space and meaning that if we want to count the number of states (or equivalently add them up) we can use the density of points in <span class="arithmatex">\(k-\)</span>space to construct an approximation to the sum over <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbf{k}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \langle E \rangle \approx 3 \frac{L^3}{(2\pi)^3} \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{k} \hbar \omega(\mathbf{k}) \left(n_{\mathrm{B}} (\beta\hbar\omega(\mathbf{k})) + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]</div>
<p>We then compute move into spherical coordinates to compute this integral (or at least it to a one-dimensional integral) as the system is isotropic, so we can write</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \langle E \rangle \approx 3 \frac{L^3}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^{\infty} \mathrm{d}k ~ 4\pi k^2 ~ \hbar \omega(\mathbf{k}) \left(n_{\mathrm{B}} (\beta\hbar\omega(\mathbf{k})) + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]</div>
<p>which is essentially in the form as requested, given we know that for sound, <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega = v_s k\)</span>. The only other point of note is that the integral in this case is over all <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span> (or equivalently <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega\)</span>), whereas that presented is up to a maximum frequency. This is a fundamental assumption of the Debye model, and the change of limit can just be imposed, but the change definitely warrants a comment!</p>
<p>The question would have been better written combining it with the next part, but I was trying to lay out the question with bite-sized steps that could follow. You be the judge of whether that worked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming linear dispersion, what is the density of states <span class="arithmatex">\(g(\omega)\)</span> in the above expression?</p>
<p>Most of the heavy lifting had been done by this point, we just need to finish transforming the equation above explicitly using the relation <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega = v_s k\)</span>:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[\begin{align*}
\langle E \rangle &amp; \approx 3 \frac{L^3}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^{\infty} \mathrm{d}k ~ 4\pi k^2 ~ \hbar \omega(\mathbf{k}) \left(n_{\mathrm{B}}(\beta\hbar\omega(\mathbf{k})) + \frac{1}{2}\right) \\
&amp; = \frac{12\pi L^3}{(2\pi)^3 v_s^3} \int_0^{\infty} \mathrm{d}\omega ~ \omega^2 ~ \hbar \omega \left(n_{\mathrm{B}} (\beta\hbar\omega) + \frac{1}{2}\right) \\
&amp; = \int_0^{\omega_\textrm{cutoff}} \mathrm{d}\omega~g(\omega)~\hbar\omega~\left(n_\mathrm{B}(\beta\hbar\omega(\mathbf{k})) + \frac{1}{2} \right)
\end{align*}\]</div>
<p>where we identify the density of states</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
g(\omega) = \frac{12\pi L^3 \omega^2}{(2\pi)^3 v_s^3}
\]</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cutoff frequency can be evaluated by ensuring there are the correct number of modes in the system. If there are <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span> oscillators, what should be the total number of modes? Justify your response.</p>
<p>If we have <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span> oscillators, there should be <span class="arithmatex">\(3N\)</span> modes, as there are 3 degrees of freedom (three dimensions of motion) for each oscillator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute the cutoff frequency <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega_{\textrm{cutoff}}\)</span></p>
<p>With the response from above and the definition of the density of states
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
3N & = \int_0^{\omega_\textrm{cutoff}} \mathrm{d}\omega~g(\omega) \\
& = \int_0^{\omega_\textrm{cutoff}} \mathrm{d}\omega~g(\omega) \frac{12\pi L^3 \omega^2}{(2\pi)^3 v_s^3}
& = \frac{12\pi L^3 \omega^2}{3(2\pi)^3 v_s^3} \omega_\textrm{cutoff}^3
\end{align*}</script>
</p>
<p>and therefore</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\omega_\textrm{cutoff}^3 = 6\pi^2v_s^2\frac{N}{L^3} = 6\pi^2v_s^2 n
\]</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A triumph of Debye's theory was the explanation of the cubic dependence on temperature for the heat capacity at low temperature. Briefly explain why this behaviour occurs.</p>
<p>Without going to town, we have an expression for the total energy in the system <span class="arithmatex">\(\langle E \rangle\)</span>, so in principle we could compute the heat capacity directly through
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C = \frac{\partial <span class="arithmatex">\(\langle E \rangle\)</span>}{\partial T}
</script>
When evaluated, the energy <span class="arithmatex">\(\langle E \rangle\)</span> (perhaps unsurprisingly) yields an <span class="arithmatex">\(E \propto T^4\)</span> relation - see the Stefan-Boltzmann law here and thus the <script type="math/tex">C \propto T^3 </script> behaviour, but physically, we have a system which is able to store more energy at low temperature than an Einstein solid. Why is this the case? Well, Einstein has independent harmonic osciallators, which are "all or nothing", in that for <span class="arithmatex">\(E&lt;\hbar\omega\)</span>, nothing can happen, whereas the Debye model allows for energy to be stored in the collective oscillations of the system (phonons) and thus the system still reacts at low temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Careful observation of the heat capacity for metals at very low temperatures shows deviation from this cubic behaviour. Provide a brief explanation for this discrepancy.</p>
<p>This is such a natural next question: where else can I store energy? Well at really low temperature, even the collective oscillations start to freeze out, but for a system of free electrons (as is modelled in the Sommerfeld model), the system can absorb small amounts of energy through the excitation of electrons at the Fermi surface. Note that this ties in nicely with material from the latter part of the course where we spent much time looking at the origins of Fermi surfaces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="question-2">Question 2<a class="headerlink" href="#question-2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This question focuses on incorporating microscopic structure into the physics of solids in one dimension.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider a one-dimensional diatomic chain, where the spring constants between neighbouring atoms are identical and equal to <span class="arithmatex">\(\kappa\)</span>, but neighbouring masses are different, alternating between <span class="arithmatex">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(m_2\)</span>.
You are going to derive the dispersion relation for this system.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sketch the system as described above, ensuring to mark the unit cell length <span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> on the diagram</p>
<p>See an image shamelessly pulled from assignment 3. Given I made it, I feel I can own "sketching" this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/PE-chain.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Denoting the position of the <span class="arithmatex">\(n^{\textrm{th}}\)</span> particle of mass <span class="arithmatex">\(m_1\)</span> as <span class="arithmatex">\(x_n\)</span> and the position of the <span class="arithmatex">\(n^{\textrm{th}}\)</span> particle of mass <span class="arithmatex">\(m_2\)</span> as <span class="arithmatex">\(y_n\)</span>, show that the equations of motion for the system are
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
m_1 \ddot{\delta x_n} & = -\kappa (\delta x_n - \delta y_{n-1}) - \kappa (\delta x_n - \delta y_n) \\
m_2 \ddot{\delta y_n} & = -\kappa (\delta y_n - \delta x_n) - \kappa (\delta y_n - \delta x_{n+1})
\end{align*}</script>
</p>
<p>These equations are constructed from Newton's second law, and are best illustrated through an image (hence the requirement to sketch it above!) where one can see that the force on <span class="arithmatex">\(x_n\)</span> in the <span class="arithmatex">\(-x\)</span> direction will be given by <span class="arithmatex">\(\kappa\)</span> times the extension/compression <span class="arithmatex">\(\delta x_n - \delta y_{n-1}\)</span> and the force in the <span class="arithmatex">\(+x\)</span> direction will be given by <span class="arithmatex">\(\kappa\)</span> times the extension/compression <span class="arithmatex">\(\delta y_n - \delta x_n\)</span>, which when combined (taking care with the signs!) yields the top equation, and the 2<span class="arithmatex">\(^\textrm{nd}\)</span> equation can be constructed similarly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solve that above set of equations for the normal modes of the system to show that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \omega^{2} =\frac{\kappa}{m_{1} m_{2}}\left(m_{1}+m_{2} \pm \sqrt{m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+2 m_{1} m_{2} \cos (k a)}\right) </script>
</p>
<p>As we are looking for normal modes, we look for solutions where all bodies oscillate with the same frequency <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega\)</span>, namely we look for wave-like solutions of the form</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
\delta x_{n} &amp;=A_{x} e^{i k a n-i \omega t} \\
\delta y_{n} &amp;=A_{y} e^{i k a n-i \omega t}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>which plugged into our equations of motion gives</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
-m_{1} \omega^{2} A_{x} e^{i k n a} &amp;=-2 \kappa A_{x} e^{i k n a}+\kappa A_{y}\left(e^{i k n a}+e^{i k(n-1) a}\right) \\
-m_{2} \omega^{2} A_{y} e^{i k n a} &amp;=-2 \kappa A_{y} e^{i k n a}+\kappa A_{x}\left(e^{i k n a}+e^{i k(n+1) a}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>which can be simplified into</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
\omega^{2} A_{x} &amp;=2\left(\kappa / m_{1}\right) A_{x}-\left(\kappa / m_{1}\right)\left(1+e^{-i k a}\right) A_{y} \\
\omega^{2} A_{y} &amp;=2\left(\kappa / m_{2}\right) A_{y}-\left(\kappa / m_{2}\right)\left(1+e^{i k a}\right) A_{x}
\end{aligned}
\]</div>
<p>which defines an eigenvalue problem for <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega^2\)</span>. Therefore we must find the roots of the determinant</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\left|\begin{array}{cc}
2\left(\kappa / m_{1}\right)-\omega^{2} &amp; -\left(\kappa / m_{1}\right)\left(1+e^{-i k a}\right) \\
-\left(\kappa / m_{2}\right)\left(1+e^{i k a}\right) &amp; 2\left(\kappa / m_{2}\right)-\omega^{2}
\end{array}\right|
\]</div>
<p>which yields the equation</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[

<p>Find the sound velocity for the acoustic branch around <span class="arithmatex">\(k=0\)</span></p>
<p>The acoustic branch(es) are those which <em>by definition</em> have a dispersion around <span class="arithmatex">\(k=0\)</span> which is linear, and thus, one can immediately write
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \omega = v_s k </script>
and moreover, we know that <span class="arithmatex">\(\omega = \sqrt{\kappa/m}\)</span> for harmonic potentials. But this is not really finding the velocity, just knowing what it should be! To find it, we must expand the low-energy band around <span class="arithmatex">\(k=0\)</span> in the expression above:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[

&amp; \approx \frac{\kappa}{m_{1} m_{2}}\left(m_{1}+m_{2} \pm \sqrt{m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+2 m_{1} m_{2} (1 - \frac{k^2 a^2}{2})}\right) \\

<p>We now alter our one-dimensional diatomic chain to a triatomic chain. How many optical modes and how many acoustic modes would you expect?</p>
<p>If there are 3 atoms per unit cell, we would expect 3 modes, one of which will be acoustic and two will be optical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one-dimensional chain provides an excellent model for understanding the properties of solids in one dimension. With explicit reference to covalent bonding as modelled through the linear combination of atomic orbitals, explain why it that we can use a harmonic potential to well describe the interatomic potential.</p>
<p>If we consider two distinct atoms, with some interatomic separation <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta x\)</span>, to model the electronic states of the system we must consider the influence of both nuclei and the other electron for a given electron, for which we construct a Hamiltonian <span class="arithmatex">\(\hat{H} = \hat{V}_1 + \hat{V}_2 + \hat{K}\)</span>. In the simplest case of <abbr title="Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals">LCAO</abbr>, we consider only the ground state for each atom and make an assumption: that the states of out new (combined) system will be a linear combination of our original states. To calculate the energy of these new states, we use the variational method (which is done in its full glory in the <a href="../../2-chemistry/2-1-chemistry">Chemistry section of the notes</a>) but the ultimate outcome is that we end up with bonding and antibonding states which have an energy determined by the interatomic spacing, as shown in the plot below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="2-1-separation" /></p>
<p>This model has not taken into account the interaction between nuclei, and thus this is not actually physical: we know that matter does not collapse into a singularity, and thus when we include a repulsive force at small atomic separations, we end up with a potential like that shown below (in this case the Lenard-Jones potential):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="3-1-potential" /></p>
<p>From here is almost a mathematical exercise, in that we have a potential which has a local minimum, and thus we can approximate this local minimum to be a parabola, that is a harmonic potential. This is not always going to work well, but for low temperatures oscillations within this potential will have sufficiently small amplitude such that the potential landscape is well modelled by a parabola. A plot of the above potential with a parabolic approximation is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="3-1-potentialwithapprox" /></p>
<p>Limitations of this approximation come in the form of high temperature behaviour, and anisotropy. The origin of this is stunningly not profound: when the potential ceases to look like a parabola, approximating it with a parabola is not a good idea. A notable example of the failure of this model is that it does not predict thermal expansion as this requires anharmonicity in the potential (see assignment two), but in many cases, it can provide a qualitative understanding of basic material properties. Moreover (and much deeper down the rabbit hole) the formulations of field theories which are centred around creation and annihilation operators have a direct link to harmonic potentials, meaning these systems have a trivial generalisation (well, a well-trodden generalisation) to more advanced formalisms.</p>

<p>Now consider the case of pure Cs, which has the same structure but with the chlorine atom replaced by a caesium atom  (a simple cubic with the basis Cs at [0,0,0] and [1/2, 1/2, 1/2]).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What kind of bonding would you expect for this structure?</p>
<p>We would expect this type of system to be metallic, which in some sense is akin to covalent bonding, whereby it is energetically favourable for the electrons to be shared across the system rather than be localised on individual nuclei.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a previous result or otherwise, compute the structure factor <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span> for X-ray scattering for pure Cs with a general set of Miller indices <span class="arithmatex">\((hkl)\)</span></p>
<p>From the previous question, we can make the substitution <span class="arithmatex">\(f_{\textrm{Cl}} \rightarrow f_{\textrm{Cs}}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
S_{(hkl)} = f_{\mathrm{Cs}} \left[1 + (-1)^{h+k+l} \right]
\]</div>
<p>which we can clearly identify will vanish for some values of <span class="arithmatex">\((hkl)\)</span>, that is, a selection rule exists.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the case of X-ray scattering from the planes defined by the Miller indices (210). What scattered intensity would one expect in the case of CsCl versus pure Cs?</p>
<p>We can see in the case of pure Cs, the structure factor and hence the scattered intensity will go to zero for <span class="arithmatex">\(h+k+l\)</span> being odd, and thus for (210) no scattered intensity will be measured. In the case of CsCl, one cannot say too much without knowing the from factors <span class="arithmatex">\(f_{\mathrm{Cs}} + f_{\mathrm{Cl}}\)</span>, but there will be some intensity as <span class="arithmatex">\(f_{\mathrm{Cs}} \ne f_{\mathrm{Cl}}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sample of CsCl was accidentally mislabelled, and it turns out that it is actually CsI, which has the identical structure except with Cl (<span class="arithmatex">\(Z = 17\)</span>) replaced with I (<script type="math/tex"> Z = 53</script>). Again, for diffraction from the planes defined by the Miller indices (210), what scattered intensity would expect from the CsI as compared to the CsCl? For reference, the atomic number of caesium is <span class="arithmatex">\(Z = 55\)</span>.</p>
<p>What a follow up question! Basically, in the previous question, we could not say all too much about <span class="arithmatex">\(f_{\mathrm{Cs}}\)</span> or  <span class="arithmatex">\(f_{\mathrm{Cl}}\)</span>, but as a very vague general trend, <span class="arithmatex">\(f \sim Z\)</span>, and thus with a <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta Z = 38\)</span> in the case of CsCl, the form factors will not be all that similar. In the case of CsI, <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta Z = 2\)</span> and thus one would expect the form factors to be close, and thus the scattered intensity for (210) would be much supressed as compared to the CsCl case/</p>

<h2 id="question-4">Question 4<a class="headerlink" href="#question-4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This question focuses on band structure and its applications</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is meant by the free electron model, the nearly-free electron model and the tight binding model? In what circumstances are the models appropriate?</p>
<p>In all cases, one should consider the models as determining which momentum states exist (and hence can be occupied). In the case of the free electron model, all possible states can be occupied, they are after all free electrons, so there is no potential which enforces reciprocal space structure. The nearly-free electron model is a weak perturbation to the free electron model by a periodic potential, whereby we have a system where electrons act mostly as free electrons, except for when the wavefunction has a strong component on the length-scale/momentum scale of the perturbing periodic potential. The tight binding model (as the same suggests) arises when we consider systems where electrons are tightly bound to a parent nucleus, so in some sense one could think of this as a <em>very</em> strong perturbation of the free electron system, where there properties are determined solely but the periodic potential.</p>
<p>Free electron model is appropriate for free electrons and is superseded in most in materials by the nearly-free electron model, as the strength of the perturbation due to the crystal structure can always be dialled back. But this is an important point: if a Fermi surface for a material looks like a sphere, it is going to be (or rather is) well approximated by the free electron model. On the other extreme, if the Fermi surface matches the Brillouin zone (that is, there isn't a Fermi surface) the system is well described by the tight binding model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a square lattice of monovalent atoms in two dimensions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Roughly sketch the first Brillouin zone for the lattice (only the shape is important), and indicate the Fermi sea in the absence of a periodic potential</p>
<p>The reciprocal lattice of a square lattice will also be a square lattice, and the Wigner-Seitz cell of a square lattice is a square. This question is very qualitative, but is one of the most important concepts in this course, hence its appearance here.</p>
<p>Rather than just providing a sketch, this is a full calculation and so obviously beyond what would be expected. The dispersion relation - a surface in 2D - is shown, along with a contour plot of this surface. As each <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span> state can hold 2 electrons, <span class="arithmatex">\(50\%\)</span> of the Brillouin zone will be filled (in this case area) with the lowest states being preferentially filled. The free-electron dispersion relationship is a parabaloid, and hence we get a circular Fermi surface, with the Fermi sea being the interior of this circle.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/PE-free.svg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the process above for both a weak and strong periodic potential</p>
<p>Shown below is the dispersion surface in the tight-binding model (which you can think of as a <em>very</em> strong periodic potential), which in contrast to the Fermi circle of a free-electron, makes a Fermi square:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/PE-tightbinding.svg" /></p>
<p>A weaker periodic potential would be in-between these extremes, a circle with the points closest to the Brillouin zone boundaries filled more due to band bending.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barium (<span class="arithmatex">\(Z = 56\)</span>) is a divalent atom, and the Fermi surface is shown below:
<img alt="" class="center" src="../images/PE-Ba.jpg" />
Explain the features of this surface, explicitly referencing the 2D analogues from the previous section, and what statements (if any) can be made about the conductivity and specific heat of barium based upon the Fermi surface alone?</p>
<p><strong>Still needs to be finished</strong>, but the if we consider a square BZ, a divalent nearly-free electron system would have a Fermi surface something like a circle with the same area as the BZ, but with points outside the square, that is bits that protrude into the 2nd BZ. Think of this like the extended/reduced zone schemes in 1D: when something is in the 2nd BZ (in the extended zone) this is the same as the excited 1st branch in the reduced zone scheme: we are just seeing this is 3D. The fact that there is a Fermi surface at all mean that there are nearby states which electrons can occupy, and thus the system can absorb energy: this will be a metal, and conduct both heat and electricity. It is also Barium, which you (may) know is a metal!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a semiconductor quantum well: a material which is uniform Al<span class="arithmatex">\(_x\)</span>Ga<span class="arithmatex">\(_{1-x}\)</span>As with a thin layer of GaAs that is a material that has three regions. Recall that the energy eignestates of a quantum well have energies
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2 m L^2}\)</span>\)</span>
We can model this system as a two-dimensional electron gas.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Show that the density of states for a free electron gas is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> g(E) = \frac{m}{\pi \hbar^2} \Theta(E) </script>
where <span class="arithmatex">\(\Theta(E)\)</span> is the Heaviside step function</p>
<p>I don't know why I used in <span class="arithmatex">\(E\)</span> in this question, but I am going to stick with the convention of the course to use <span class="arithmatex">\(\varepsilon\)</span> for the energy. In two dimensions, the number of states is given by</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
N = 2 \frac{A}{(2\pi)^2} \int_0^{k_F} \mathrm{d}\mathbf{k}
\]</div>
<p>which evaluates to</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
N = \frac{A}{2\pi} k_F^2
\]</div>
<p>or equivalently <span class="arithmatex">\(n= N/A = k_F^2/2\pi\)</span>. For a free electron:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\varepsilon = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}
\]</div>
<p>and thus</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
n = \frac{2m \varepsilon_F}{2\pi\hbar^2}
\]</div>
<p>By the definition of the denisty of states per unit volume, we have also that</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
n = \int_0^{\varepsilon_F} g(\varepsilon) \mathrm{d}\varepsilon
\]</div>
<p>and thus</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
g(\varepsilon) = \frac{m}{\pi\hbar^2}
\]</div>
<p>Note using <span class="arithmatex">\(g(\varepsilon) = \mathrm{d}n / \mathrm{d}\varepsilon\)</span> yields the same result. The inclusion of the Heaviside step function is necessary as states that have a negative energy should not be included, which is obviously clear in the case of a free electron, but when we have electrons and holes in wells, we must be much more careful!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show that the density of states for electrons in the well is given by
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> g(E) = \frac{m_e^*}{\pi \hbar^2} \sum_{n>0} \Theta \left(E - E_c - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2 m_e^*} \frac{n^2}{L^2}\right)  </script>
where <span class="arithmatex">\(E_c\)</span> is the conduction band energy.</p>
<p>In a quantum well, we will have the two-dimensional behaviour of the free electron plus the inclusion of the discretised states of the quantum well. We also must include the effective mass of the electron, as it is no longer a free electron. So the energy of an electron in a given state state in the well described by quantum number <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> is</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\varepsilon_n = \varepsilon_c + \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2 m_e^* L^2} + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_e^*}
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="arithmatex">\(\varepsilon_c\)</span> is the minimum energy of the conduction band (the bottom of the well). As the conduction band energy and well energy is independent of <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span>, the density of states will be the same as above, with the appropriate subsititutions and a regonition that there are no states below the ground state of the well, that is <span class="arithmatex">\(\varepsilon\)</span> will only be non-zero above <span class="arithmatex">\(\varepsilon_c + \hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2 / 2 m_e^* L^2\)</span>, and thus</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
g(\varepsilon_n) = \frac{m_e^*}{\pi\hbar^2} \Theta\left(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_c - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2 m_e^* L^2} \right)
\]</div>
<p>But in the usual way, this is the density for a single mode <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>, and there are many possible values of <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>, and thus we must add them all up:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
g(\varepsilon) = \sum_n g(\varepsilon_n) = \frac{m_e^*}{\pi\hbar^2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Theta\left(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_c - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2 m_e^* L^2} \right)
\]</div>
<p>as required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the density of states for holes in this system?</p>
<p>There is delightfully little to do other than <span class="arithmatex">\(m_e^* \rightarrow m_h^*\)</span>, replacing the conduction band energy with the valence band energy, and recogising that only states with an energy <span class="arithmatex">\(\varepsilon\)</span> <em>below</em> <span class="arithmatex">\(\varepsilon_v - \hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2 / 2 m_h^* L^2\)</span> will be non-zero, and so one can directly write</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
g(\varepsilon) = \frac{m_h^*}{\pi\hbar^2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Theta \left(\varepsilon_v - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2 m_h^* L^2} - \varepsilon \right)
\]</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now consider a "quantum wire": a one-dimensional block of GaAs in embedded in the Al<span class="arithmatex">\(_x\)</span>Ga<span class="arithmatex">\(_{1-x}\)</span>As. The cross-section of the wire is an <span class="arithmatex">\(L \times L\)</span> square and the system is well described by a one-dimensional electron gas. Show the density of states for electrons is given by
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
g(E) = \frac{\sqrt{2 m_e^*}}{\pi \hbar} \sum_{n_1, n_2 >0} & \left(E - E_c - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2 m_e^*} \frac{n_1^2 + n_2^2}{L^2}\right)^{1/2} \\
& \times \Theta \left(E - E_c - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2 m_e^*} \frac{n_1^2 + n_2^2}{L^2}\right)
\end{aligned}
</script>
</p>
<p>This is really the definition of rinse and repeat. We had 3D in question one, 2D in the previous section and now 1D: in exactly the same manner as above, we need to calculate the density of states in one dimension and then incorporate the now 2D square well energy spectrum. For a free electron:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
N = 2 \frac{L}{2\pi} \int \mathrm{d}k
\]</div>
<p>which is one dimension is a line integral from <span class="arithmatex">\(-k_F\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(k_F\)</span> and so</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
n = \frac{N}{L} = \frac{2 k_F}{\pi}
\]</div>
<p>and <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span> is still <span class="arithmatex">\(\sqrt{2m\varepsilon}/\hbar\)</span>, so we find that</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
g(\varepsilon) = \frac{\sqrt{2m}}{\pi\hbar} E^{-1/2} \Theta (\varepsilon)
\]</div>
<p>Now in the semiconductor, <span class="arithmatex">\(m\rightarrow m_e^*\)</span> and</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\varepsilon_{n_1, n_2} = \varepsilon_c + \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n_1^2 + n_2^2}{2 m_e^* L^2} + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_e^*}
\]</div>
<p>as there it is a two-dimesnional well. Now we need add up all the states, so sum over both <span class="arithmatex">\(n_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(n_2\)</span>:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{aligned}
g(\varepsilon) &amp; = \sum_{n_1,n_2} g(\varepsilon_{n_1, n_2}) &amp; \\
&amp; = \frac{\sqrt{2m_e^*}}{\pi\hbar} \sum_{n_1=1}^{\infty} \sum_{n_2=1}^{\infty} &amp; \left(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_c - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n_1^2 + n_2^2}{2 m_e^* L^2} \right)^{-1/2} \\
&amp; &amp; \times \Theta \left(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_c - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n_1^2 + n_2^2}{2 m_e^* L^2} \right)
\end{aligned}
